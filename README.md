## Summary

The [TranspiledActionScript](https://transpiledactionscript.com/) is an idea to have all the updates on what is happening in [Apache Royale™](http://royale.apache.org/) project in one place. This repository will present information as code snippets, utils, wiki articles as well as more sophisticated examples, some of which will be at a certain point moved to Apache Royale™ project. 

## How it works 

The repository will contain three branches, i.e. examples, snippets and utils. Each branch will have its own main folder, – Examples, Snippets and Utils, respectively. The branches can be described in the following way: 

[examples](https://github.com/piotrzarzycki21/TranspiledActionScript/tree/examples) - will contain the Examples folder, in which each created subfolder will present an example with files that can be opened and built using the IDEs currently supporting Apache Royale™ ([Moonshine IDE](http://moonshine-ide.com/), Visual Studio Code by [NextGen ActionScript](https://nextgenactionscript.com/) plugin). Additionally, examples will contain Maven "pom.xml" files which will allow to build the examples without IDE involvement. As one of the purposes of this branch is to presents the newest features available in Apache Royale™, the written code will always use the “Nightly build” of Apache Royale™.

[snippets](https://github.com/piotrzarzycki21/TranspiledActionScript/tree/snippets) - will contain the Snippets folder, in which each created subfolder will include files (ActionScript classes, MXML files) containing short presentation of an interesting code in Apache Royale™, along with a proper description, usually in a separate GitHub .md file.

[utils](https://github.com/piotrzarzycki21/TranspiledActionScript/tree/utils) – will contain everything which does not fit the "examples" or "snippets" branches, but can be helpful while developing your applications in Apache Royale™.

## Releases

The release will take place as soon as enough helpful information is gathered in one of the branches. All the updated branches will be merged into the "master" branch at a certain point, the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/piotrzarzycki21/TranspiledActionScript/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) will be updated and the release will be announced to you.
